Challenge: Wholesale Data Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset containing order information for clients, focusing on transforming and summarizing the data for actionable insights.
Steps to Complete the Challenge
Part 1: Explore the Data
Import the dataset and inspect column names and statistics.
Identify:
The top 3 item categories by the number of entries.
The subcategory with the most entries in the top category.
The 5 clients with the most entries and their total quantities.
Store the top client IDs in a list.
Part 2: Transform the Data
Create new columns:
Subtotal: unit_price * qty
Shipping Price: Based on unit weight ($7/lb for weights over 50 lbs, $10/lb otherwise).
Total Price: Includes subtotal, shipping price, and a sales tax of 9.25%.
Line Cost: Uses unit_cost, qty, and shipping_price.
Profit: Difference between line_price and line_cost.
Part 3: Confirm Your Work
Verify the total prices for the following orders against provided receipts:
Order ID 2742071: $152,811.89
Order ID 2173913: $162,388.71
Order ID 6128929: $923,441.25
Part 4: Summarize and Analyze
Calculate the total spending of the top 5 clients.
Create a summary DataFrame with:
Total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit.
Format the summary in millions of dollars, sort by total profit, and rename columns for presentation.
Write a 2â€“3 sentence summary of findings.
